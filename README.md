# Gun-Gun 2023
A retro synthwave inspired movement shooter I tried to develop.

I was inspired to start this project by a movie I still enjoy to this day "Drive". I had scrapped a previous project, Bludlust, but still wanted to make a movement shooter. So I decided on a sythwave/outrun style aesthetic.

The main mechanic would revolve around the player character's gun, a revolver. The idea was to reward the player for reloading and firing at certain tempos or timing, creating emergent gameplay whilst moving around and such.

This project didn't get too far into production, however I did manage expand my knowledge on fancy shaders and satisfying character controllers.

Here is a screenshot of an old prototype build:

The Unity files of this project are lost to time, which is sad because I remember developing quite a bit after the included build. I also uploaded the assets I used for this project, so peruse through them at your own leisure.
